# ReactiveTODO

Simple TODO note application for the iOS system written in Swift.

![Screencast](https://github.com/turekj/ReactiveTODO/blob/master/Docs/Images/screencast.gif?raw=true)

## Goal

The app was not built with amazing features in mind. It was done solely to showcast some top-of-the-line iOS app architecture patterns / tools and methodologies. The app makes use of:

- [x] [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) as a modern iOS programming language
- [x] [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) as a dependency manager
- [x] [ReactiveKit](https://github.com/ReactiveKit/ReactiveKit) to introduce reactive programming & MVVM pattern
- [x] [Realm](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/) as a modern mobile database system
- [x] [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject) to back up Dependency Injection pattern
- [x] [Quick + Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) for behavior-driven development methodology
- [x] [Cartography](https://github.com/robb/Cartography) to create AutoLayout-powered views programatically with ease
